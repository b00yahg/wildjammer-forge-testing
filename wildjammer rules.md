# CHAPTER 3: WILDJAMMERS

No game of Wildjammer would be complete without the wildjammers themselves! It doesn't matter if you're looking to be pirates, privateers, part of a trading company, a group of mercenaries or bounty hunters, or explorers into the great unknown, you're going to need a ship to move around wildspace. This chapter is going to focus on describing everything you need to know about wildjammers, from how they work to their statistics and even how to fight with them!

This chapter will begin by reviewing the five major components that make up a wildjammer. They are:

• The Helm. A throne through which a Helmsman can control and propel the ship through space.
• Ship Weapons. The powerful armaments that help to protect a wildjammer on its travels. 
• Modules & Upgrades. Additions to a wildjammer which grant it unique abilities or extra statistics.
• The Fore Mantle. A mount secured to the front of a wildjammer that can equip special ship weapons, a magical figurehead, or a ram.
• The Hull. The general shape and structure of the ship that primarily determines its statistics.

## THE HELM

On traditional Age of Sail ships, a ship's helm is that large steering wheel with spokes extending from it. In Wildjammer, helms take on the appearance of large thrones that act as magical conduits. If a spellcaster sits on one of these and attunes to it like a magic item, their senses and perceptions are extended across the entire wildjammer as if it was their own body. While in this bond, this Helmsman can propel the ship rapidly to cover the vast distances of space.

The helm I just described is a Windjammer Helm, the most easily found type of helm thanks to the effort of their main purveyors, the Arcane. That said, there are many kinds of helms found in wildspace. Mind flayers use a Pool Helm, a type of brine pool filled with illithid slugs which draws power from the psionics of the Helmsman. There's the Orbus, a weak and enslaved beholder-kin who is used by other beholders to propel their Tyrant Ships. Dwarves favor a helm called the Forge Helm, which when installed into the core of a mountain can create propulsion from the energy of their creations, resulting in flying mountains. The neogi favor a type of helm called a Lifejammer Helm, an iron maiden like device that drains the blood and essence out of slaves and converts it into propulsion. Even these helms are only the tip of the iceberg.

While the Wildjammer Helm is the most popular due to how easily they are to get, there are countless designs!
### ACQUIRING A HELM

A species of blue skinned giants called the Arcane run an incredibly powerful cartel that controls the sale and distribution of all Wildjammer Helms in the spheres. No one knows where the Arcane come from or how they build the Wildjammer Helms, just that they are the only ones who sell them and anyone who tries to cut in on that market quickly ends up dead.

Luckily the Arcane make it easy to get a hold of them. By simply spreading around any major city in any of the spheres that you're looking for the Arcane, word will get back to them and they will contact you in a short time. This means Wildjammer Helms are never hard to find if you know how to contact the Arcane.

As mentioned, there are helms beside Wildjammer Helms. Most of these are designed for specific types of ships or have limited functionality. This leads to most wildjammers making use of a Wildjammer Helm.

### USING A HELM

To make use of a helm, a spellcaster needs to meet the prerequisites to attune to the helm as shown on the item's description. Although this is an attunement, attuning to a Wildjammer Helm doesn't use up one of the character's attunement slots, it just takes a half-hour to become attuned.

When a spellcaster becomes attuned to a Wildjammer Helm, they are treated as that ship's Helmsman. Their body is partially paralyzed, leaving them only control over their mouth and hands. In this state, they are unable to defend themselves from attack unless they first break attunement with the helm. Similarly, they are unable to get up from the helm until they break attunement with it by taking another half-hour. Due to this vulnerability while attuned to the helm, most wildjammers are designed with the helm in a highly defensible room.

Although the Helmsman loses a great deal of control over their own body, they gain considerable control over the ship, as if it was their body. Their senses are extended across the ship and can move it the same way they would start walking. Additionally, while attuned to the helm, the Helmsman is also able to deploy their senses to any spot on the wildjammer, as if they had an ethereal body to walk around with.

If a wildjammer ever has to make a saving throw or skill check, the Helmsman makes that roll with their own character's statistics.

A Helmsman can stay attuned for up to 12 hours a day before they start risking exhaustion, as per the Forced March rules (PHB, pg. 181). Attunement can be ended at any time, though some helms may have a backlash effect when you do.

> #### The Arcane's Monopoly
> 
> A species of highly secretive merchants, the Arcane are the only known distributors of Wildjammer Helms. Anyone who is aware of wildjammers and wants to buy a Wildjammer Helm need only circulate around the rumor mill of a large city that they are looking for the Arcane. Usually within a week, they will have a secretive meeting with one of these blue giants.
> 
> As eager as the Arcane are to make deals, they are just as protective of their status as the sole purveyors of Wildjammer Helms. Just about everyone who sails through wildspace and the flow has heard a story of some captain trying to sell a Wildjammer Helm they looted secondhand. The stories always end with a gruesome death at the hands of Arcane enforcers. They seem to have some type of ability to track Wildjammer Helms and know if someone is the licensed owner. Thanks to this combination of seemingly omnipotent knowledge of every helm and the severity of their enforcement, no black market has ever emerged.
> 
> If a captain does acquire a Wildjammer Helm that they wish to sell, the Arcane will pay 10% of the Wildjammer Helm's value as a finder's fee. Alternatively, they can transfer ownership of the helm to the captain for a fee of 10% of the helm's value.

## SPEEDS

There are three speeds we deal with in Wildjammer: tactical, jamming, and planetary.

### TACTICAL SPEED

When moving at tactical speed, a Helmsman and crew have considerable control over a ship's movement. At this speed, the ship can move according to its speed and its maneuverability. This allows it to move up to docks, up to another ships, or engage in ship combat.

In this system, tactical speed is based on the stats of the wildjammer itself. Smaller wildjammers tend to move quicker and work with cheaper helms, while the heavier wildjammers tend to have lower speeds and require stronger helms to move them.

### JAMMING SPEED

While tactical speed is great for maneuvering, it isn't as great for covering the vast distances in wildspace. For that, we need jamming speeds. A Helmsman can propel their ship to jamming speeds by channeling magic into the helm for a minute. A wildjammer can't accelerate to jamming speed while in the gravity field of another mega scale object or mega creature.

When moving at jamming speed, the ship always moves in a straight line at a speed of 100 million miles per day, or 4 million miles per hour (mph). With multiple spellcasters to take the Helm, a ship could travel from Earth to the Sun in just under a day.

While at jamming speed, small debris is ignored. It's only when encountering an object on mega scale that jamming speeds fail. Should a wildjammer be traveling and get close to a mega creature, wildjammer, celestial body, or some other large object on mega scale, the wildjammer immediately slows to tactical speed. This sudden loss of speed doesn't cause any whiplash for those aboard, but it does mean the wildjammer has to maneuver around the obstacle and spend another minute charging the helm to accelerate back to jamming speeds.

### PHLOGISTON TRAVEL

Travel through the phlogiston happens like wildspace travel, with tactical speeds and jamming speeds. There are two major differences though. First, distance isn't well understood between the spheres, so the trip from one sphere to another is best expressed as how long it takes to travel there. This time is entirely up to the DM.

The second major change is the existence of flow rivers. Flow rivers are currents that naturally appear in the phlogiston between crystal spheres. These flow rivers act as guides for a ship's Helmsman who can see them while attuned to the Helm.

### PLANETARY TRAVEL

The last type is planetary travel. On average, sailing ships tend to travel at 4 mph over water and an airship at 9 mph through air. A wildjammer's tactical speed leaves both of these in the dust, but a wildjammer's tactical speed is designed for the gravity free, open environment of wildspace.

While in a planet's atmosphere, a wildjammer can use Hover Sailing to travel through the air up to 20 mph for each level of the highest unexpended spell slot the Helmsman has. For example, a Helmsman with an unexpended 3rd level spell slot and no higher spell slots can Hover Sail up to 60 mph. For ease of play, if you get into a ship fight in a planet's atmosphere, use your ship's tactical speed as if you were in wildspace.

While this method of travel is convenient, it isn't inconspicuous. Be wary of calling attention to yourself, as you never know how far an adventuring party will go to steal your ship!
## MANEUVERABILITY

The mechanics of wildjammer combat I've discussed so far are all fairly simple. In the combat section, I talked about how mega scale encounters attempt to mimic ground scale combat as closely as possible. Sadly, there is one mechanic that needs to be added that has no ground scale equivalent: maneuverability.

Generally speaking, maneuverability is the degree to which the wildjammer can turn while in motion. In ground scale combat, we're used to being able to move in any direction up to our speed. While controlling a ship in a mega scale encounter, we are limited in how much we can turn.

Picture a ship sailing on the sea. If they wanted to turn around, could they pivot on the spot? Not really. They could try doing some fancy maneuvers, but turning a large ship generally takes a bit of time and an arc in the path they sail.

To deal with this mechanically, every wildjammer has a maneuverability score. This score can be 360º, 180º, 135º, 90º, 45º, and 0º. When a wildjammer moves, it moves up to its speed within a forward cone equal to the maneuverability score (see the diagrams below). After moving, the ship turns that many degrees left or right. For ease of play, you can just reasonably estimate the cones of maneuverability.

These maneuverability values are multiples of 45º, which corresponds well to a grid. Each square of a grid has 4 sides and 4 corners. A 45º turn is turning from a face to an adjacent corner or from a corner to an adjacent face. For example, if your ship's speed is 3,000 ft. (90º) and it's facing to the left on your battle map, the ship can move up to 3,000 feet in a 90º cone facing left, and then turn from facing left to face up-left, up, down-left, or down.

For those of you who play gridless or use hexes, use whatever works at your table! Just adjust these rules to take account of it. Hex play will probably be the toughest as this system is designed around grid or gridless to match up with normal fifth edition combat.

It's also worth noting that while a wildjammer is sailing at wildjammer speed, the crew do not need to actively work the sails because a wildjammer can't turn while at that speed. Crew still need to be standing by at the ready in case they get pulled out of jamming speed by something!

### INTERACTION WITH THE CREW

Although the propulsion of a wildjammer is primarily from the Helmsman, it is the crew working the sails that give the wildjammer its maneuverability. Every wildjammer has a minimum number of crew required, representing how many people it takes to properly work the sails. When your wildjammer has fewer than the minimum number of crew necessary, your ship's maneuverability is reduced based on the deficit. The degree of penalty is ultimately up to the DM discretion based on circumstance, but the below table can be used as a rough guideline for penalties.

Note that if a ship's sails are attacked and disabled, the ship's maneuverability is always reduced to 0º.

| Crew Deficit % Under Minimum | 360º | 180º | 135º | 90º | 45º |
|------------------------------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| -1% to -25%                  | 180º | 135º | 90º  | 45º | 0º  |
| -26% to -50%                 | 135º | 90º  | 45º  | 45º | 0º  |
| -51% to -75%                 | 90º  | 45º  | 45º  | 0º  | 0º  |
| -76% to -99%                 | 45º  | 45º  | 0º   | 0º  | 0º  |

## TYPE OF HELMS

The helms in this section are presented in alphabetical order. A helm's description gives its name, value, any prerequisites to attune to it, and its properties. Only wildjammers of schooner size (mega small) or larger can have a helm installed unless the wildjammer's description says otherwise.

### ARTIFURNACE

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement), Priceless**

This helm is a modernized version of the Furnace Helm. Like the Furnace Helm, the Artifurnace is designed to burn magical items and convert their power into propulsion. However, the Artifurnace is designed to draw power from an artifact tier magic item, which are known to be indestructible. As a result, the Artifurnace is an endless source of propulsion.

This Helm counts as an 11th level spellcaster for Spell Surge and Hover Sailing, though a Helmsman is still required to control the helm.

If a sentient magic item is used as the artifact in the Artifurnace, that sentient magic item becomes the Helmsman of the wildjammer.

### CROWN OF STARS

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature with spellcasting or pact magic), Priceless**

This helm functions exactly the same as a Wildjammer Helm (minor), except that it takes the form of a crown. While wearing this helm, a Helmsman does not become helpless while attuned. They can act both in mega scale combat as a Helmsman and in ground scale combat aboard their ship. If the Helmsman leaves the air envelope of the wildjammer, attunement to this helm immediately ends.

### DEATH HELM

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature with spellcasting or pact magic), 50,000gp**

This helm is identical to a Wildjammer Helm (major), except it also has the following properties.

**Cursed Item.** When a creature attunes to this helm, the creature must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the helm. While charmed, the creature finds themselves deeply enjoying being attuned to the helm. Each day that the creature attunes to the helm, the helm drains more and more of their life away, resulting in a point of exhaustion that doesn't go away with a long rest.

In addition, each day the helmsman uses the Death Helm, they must make a special death saving throw. These saving throws don't reset on a long rest and they are not cleared when the creature reaches three successes. The death saving throws are made until attunement is broken or the creature has three failures and dies.

An attuned spellcaster that succeeds on their save immediately realizes that something is wrong with the helm and can choose to break attunement before it settles in.

**Unattunement Backlash.** When a Helmsman unattunes from this helm, the Helmsman suffers a point of exhaustion and must make a special death saving throw that accumulates with the cursed item effect. Once unattuned, the creature can recover from the lost exhaustion and death saves.

### FURNACE HELM

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement), 20,000gp or 50,000gp**

This helm takes the form of a furnace that is situated at the center of a ship. Magic items can be burned in the furnace to create propulsion. For every 1,000gp of value burned this way, the furnace generates one week's worth of propulsion. Since the Furnace Helm depend upon fire, they are never used in the Flow.

The minor variant of this helm can only be used on fighters (mega tiny) or schooner (mega small) size wildjammers, as it doesn't produce enough power to move a larger wildjammer.

The major variant of this helm can be situated on a wildjammer ranging from schooner (mega small) size to frigate (mega large) size. When hover sailing, every 1,000gp burned corresponds to one spell slot level (maximum of 5). To use Spell Surge, you burn additional items. Every 1,000gp corresponds to one spell slot level (maximum of 5), though each of these items have a 25% chance of causing an explosion that deals 10d10 mega fire damage to your wildjammer.

### SERIES HELM

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature with spellcasting or pact magic), 75,000gp per link**

This rare Helm is a series of specialized Wildjammer Helms. Each link can be attuned to by a different creature, but only one attuned creature can be the Helmsman at a time. The role of Helmsman can be transferred as an action instead of a bonus action. When the Helmsman uses Spell Surge or hover sailing, each creature can add up to 3 spell slots worth of levels to amplify the power of the helm, up to a maximum of 9 levels.

**Quick Attunement.** Functions identically to a minor Wildjammer Helm.

**Unattunement Backlash.** Functions identically to a minor Wildjammer Helm.

### WILDJAMMER HELM

**Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a creature with spellcasting or pact magic), Minor: 100,000gp | Major: 250,000gp**

This ornamental throne covered in Arcane runes comes in two varieties: minor and major. The minor variant can be installed into any wildjammer ranging from schooner (mega small) size to frigate (mega large) size. The major variant is required for heavy frigates (mega huge) or ships of the line (mega gargantuan).

**Quick Attunement.** A spellcaster can immediately attune to this Helm instead of taking an hour by expending a 2nd level spell slot (minor) or 5th-level spell slot (major).

**Unattunement Backlash.** When a Helmsman unattunes from this helm, the Helmsman is unable to cast spells using spell slots for 1d4 rounds (minor) or 2d4 rounds (major).
## SHIP WEAPONS

A wildjammer's weapons generally consist of classic siege weaponry and cannons. These weapons were designed for use in space, packing significant power and range for fending off dangerous adversaries.

A creature that is proficient with firearms or martial weapons is proficient with ship weapons. To use one of these ship weapons, a creature usually needs to be in the Gunner or Fighter Helmsman bridge crew role.

Each of these weapons, just like the ship's sails and modules, have 10 hull points each. When disabled, they can't be used until repaired by a Boatswain.

Attacks made with these ship weapons are ship weapon attacks, not melee or ranged weapon attacks. Ship weapon attacks use a creature's Strength or Dexterity modifier (their choice) for the attack roll, but don't add any modifier to the damage roll. Ship weapon attacks can only target ships, mega creatures, or other objects at mega scale.

### WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS

The following is a list of common ship weapons.

**Ballistae.** These top loaded siege weapons look much like a large crossbow. These ballistae are mounted with a reinforced central pivot allowing it to aim in any direction. The heavy version makes use of a two-point anchor, but rests on manually rotating platform that supporting crew can turn to help aim.

**Catapult.** A classic siege weapon that uses stored up tension in a single limb to release some projectile at high speeds toward a target. Many traditional catapults have lockable wheels so they can be moved and fired, but the wildjammer variant is built into the hardpoint itself. Although cannons tend to have greater damage and range, they are unusable in the phlogiston and they have a risk to backfire. As a result, catapults are still a favorite weapon for wildjammers.

**Carronade.** These short barreled cannons were among the first gunpowder based cannons to be built for wildjammer use. These cannons have a smoothbore design rather than any rifling, resulting in them being shorter ranged than other cannons. Nevertheless, its efficiency at short range has resulted in the carronade still having a place in the market.

**12 & 24-Pounder Long Gun.** These cannons are the most common type found in space. With long barrels with rifling, their range and power is a force to be reckoned with. Nevertheless, gunpowder carries danger to those sailing in the Phlogiston and always has a chance to backfire.

**36-Pounder Long Gun.** This ridiculously over-sized cannon is a favorite of the gunpowder obsessed giff. The large amount of gunpowder used per shot results in the weapon overheating each time it is fired.

**Dual Ballistae.** A dual ballista is a specialized ballista crafted to have two flight grooves for loading and firing two bolts at the same time. This requires a more substantial hardpoint mount, causing the weapon to become fixed. Additionally, firing two bolts at the same time makes it difficult to aim at long range.
**Helmseeker Launcher.** The helmseeker is a special type of explosive device designed to track the magical signature of a helm. It can track any helm capable of accelerating to jamming speeds. When deployed, you choose a wildjammer within 10,000 feet of you. After your turn, the helmseeker moves at a speed of 4,500 ft. (90º) toward the target. If it hasn't hit its target after 3 rounds of moving, the seeking magic is depleted and it loses all maneuverability, causing it to fly aimlessly until it hits something.

**Aether Charge Launcher.** This mine launcher is designed to place explosive devices that are sensitive to movements in the aether. If a ship or mega creature moves within 1,000 feet of it, the aether charge activates and you make a ship weapon attack against the target to hit them with the explosive charge.

### Special Weapons
**Fire Projector.** This small cannon consists of a series of tubes that pump a special chemical compound that ignites into flame when it touches air.

Unlike splintered wood and broken hull, damage from a fire projector is not as easy to quickly patch. As a result, this weapon deals double damage to bulwark point, more easily breaking it and dealing lasting damage to a ship's hull.

**Grappling Ballista.** A grappling ballista is a specially designed ballista meant to fire a bolt that embeds into the side of a ship and aids in a ship grapple.

When this weapon deals damage to the hull points of another ship, your ship's Captain has advantage on ship grapple checks against the target. This advantage is lost when the ropes are cut or when the target ship moves more than 1,500 feet away from your ship.

**Matick's Cannon.** The Matick's Cannon is a special kind of ship weapon. By using the magic of a spellcaster Gunner, the cannon enchants and propels a small, smooth stone that turns into bolts of brilliant energy, not unlike a magic missile.

To use this ship weapon, a Gunner must have the spellcasting or pact magic feature. When using this weapon to make ship weapon attacks, the Gunner uses their spellcasting ability modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack roll. Additionally, if the spellcaster doesn't have the Extra Attack feature but does have access to 3rd level spell slots, they are considered to have the Extra Attack feature for attacks with this ship weapon.

### WEAPON PROPERTIES

These are the properties found on ship weapons.

**Automatic.** When you make an attack with this ship weapon on your turn against a target in your normal range, you can choose to instead make two attacks at disadvantage. These attacks always have disadvantage, regardless of circumstances.

**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you make an attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from where it is stored is a part of the attack.

**Deployable.** Weapons with the deployable property are weapons which release ammunition into the battlefield as a token. These deployables might sit in place waiting for something to get close, or it may have its own speed as indicated in the parentheses.

When you would attack with this weapon, you instead use your action to deploy it into the fight, in an unoccupied space within 500 feet of your ship. When the deployable weapon makes contact with a ship or mega creature, you make a ship weapon attack against the target. Once you do, the deployable is destroyed.

If the deployable has a movement speed, it travels in a straight line up to that speed immediately following your turn. Most deployables have a special trait that give them the ability to maneuver at a target for a short time after it has been deployed. See the weapon description for more details. If the deployable doesn't provide instructions on how it moves, it travels in a straight line each turn until it makes contact with an object at mega scale, a ship, or a mega creature.

A deployable can be targeted by ship weapon attacks. Deployables have an AC of 10 and 1 hull point.

**Fixed.** When mounted, this weapon is affixed to face a certain direction. It can only make attacks against targets within a 90º cone in the direction it is facing based on the direction the ship is facing.

**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

**Overheat.** Once you make an attack with this weapon, it can't be used again to make an attack until the end of your next turn.

**Backfire.** When you make an attack with this weapon, if the unmodified die roll is equal or less than the backfire value, the weapon is reduced to 0 hull points and becomes disabled.

If the backfire score of a weapon is reduced to 0, there is no chance of a backfire. Backfire can be reduced by having a trained or expert Gunner operating it, by the Gunner being a Giff, or having Giff mercenaries act as crew for that ship mounted weapon.

**Crew.** Crew represents how many crew members in excess of a ship's minimum crew requirement is necessary to operate this weapon. If there aren't any crew members available, the weapon can't be operated.

### AMMUNITION & DEPLOYABLES

Weapons that have the ammunition or deployable property expend a resource when fired. These can be purchased at any major port in wildspace. A ship can carry up to 20 ammunition or 5 deployables for each weapon without using up cargo storage space. Any amount in excess does take up cargo storage space, as it has to be held in the cargo hold instead of with the weapon itself.

#### SPECIAL AMMUNITION

In addition to the basic ammunition, there is also some special ammunition a wildjammer can purchase.

**Alchemist's Fire Canister.** These canisters contain a large amount of alchemists fire. When launched by a catapult, the damage type of the attack becomes fire and damage dealt against bulwark points is doubled.

**Chainshot.** This catapult ammunition is made up of a pair of stones with a chain connecting them. When you fire this ammunition at an enemy ship, it hampers the smooth operation of the sails and rigging. On hit, the Helmsman must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the ship's maneuverability is reduced by 1 step until the end of your next turn.

**Helmshackle Bolts.** These specialized ballista bolts stick into the hull of a wildjammer and leech power from the helm to snare it. On hit, the Helmsman must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the movement speed of their ship reduced by 500 feet until the end of your next turn.

## CREW

What kind of sailing adventure is it with no crew? Not only are they needed to handle the sails, but they are also necessary for operating ship mounted weapons. Dealing with crew can add a fun element of resource management, or it can be a tedious and dull experience. Speak with your group to decide how detailed you want to be in managing the crew.

I tend to favor light guidelines rather than Sims level micromanagement, so the method offered in this supplement is simple. There are a few options for crew, each of which uses a creature template from the Monster Manual or Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. The cost for the crew included in the Crew Costs table is inclusive of everything they require, including income and the cost of food and water for the voyage. As a result, the extent of crew management is knowing how much the PCs have to pay the crew each month. Feel free to go into more detail if your table will enjoy it!

### GREEN & VETERAN CREW

Green crew are new sailors getting their footing. They are not combat ready and basically just do their job to keep the ship moving. In combat, they will act purely in self-defense, seeking to flee and only fight if they are backed into a corner. A party can't depend upon green crew to help in a fight! Use the Bandit (CR 1/8) from the Monster Manual (pg. 343) as a template.

After at least a year sailing the Sea of Night, green crew become veteran crew. These crew members have been sailing for a bit and they have a good bit more experience under their belt. Unlike green crew, they won't flee from combat, but they will only aid in defending the ship. A party can't depend upon veteran crew members to join them in boarding another ship, but they can depend upon veterans to defend the ship while they're away. Use the Thug (CR 1/2) from the Monster Manual (pg. 350) as a template.

### MERCENARIES

Just as green crew eventually become veterans, mercenaries are usually former veteran crew who decide to focus on making extra money by selling their combat prowess. They will work alongside the crew, defend the ship, and join in boarding an enemy ship. Use the Berserker (CR 2) from the Monster Manual (pg. 344) as a template.

### GIFF MERCENARIES

Up until recently, the giff lacked any magical ability of their own. As a result, they fell into mercenary work as a means of traveling the stars. Luckily, mercenary work fit them well! It allows them to indulge their greatest passion: Gunpowder! Giff are never shy about using gunpowder and have a childlike fascination with explosions. Giff mercenaries will work alongside the crew, defend the ship, and join in boarding parties.

The one major hitch is that giff refuse to combat other giff in combat. If both sides of a fight have giff mercenaries, the giff mercenaries don't contribute to the fight in any way. If the ships continue to fight without them, the giff aboard the winning ship will rescue the giff aboard the losing ship and drop them off at the next port.

**Gunpowder Experts.** When a weapon is crewed by a giff, that weapon's backfire chance, if any, is reduced by 1. When a weapon is entirely crewed by giff, that weapon's backfire chance, if any, is reduced by 2. This reduction can bring the backfire chance down to 0, nullifying the chance of a backfire.

Use the Giff (CR 3) from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (pg. 204) as a template.

### HURWAETI MERCENARIES

The hurwaeti are a race of ancient humanoids that seem to be distantly related to lizardfolk. It is said their once great empire was a benevolent expansionist society that brought peace and prosperity wherever it went, but the days of that empire ended following a war with aberrations. The hurwaeti are now a scattered species, working their way through space and finding vengeance on aberrations when they can.

Hurwaeti mercenaries are not easy to find as they are highly sought after. On the work side, they have incredible jumping abilities and a strong work ethic which makes them a joy to work with. They stand out most to wildjammer captains for their natural ability to purify air around them.

**Air Replenishment.** When calculating the amount of air available in a wildjammer's air bubble, for each hurwaeti aboard the ship, reduce the crew count by 2. For example, if your ship has 40 crew and 10 are hurwaeti, calculate air as if you had only 20 crew members aboard.

Use the Lizardfolk Render (CR 3) as a template from Ghosts of Saltmarsh, but treat them as medium sized.

### Crew Costs Table

| Crew Type | Cost per 1 (Day/Month) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Green Crew | 1.5gp / 45gp |
| Veteran Crew | 3gp / 90gp |
| Mercenaries | 5gp / 150gp |
| Giff Mercenaries | 6.5gp / 195gp |
| Hurwaeti Mercenaries | 8gp / 240gp |

## MODULES & UPGRADES

Modules and upgrades are enhancements you can add to your ship to increase their performance or unlock new abilities. Most ships have at least some modules or some upgrades as a way of fine tuning the ship to make it better at doing whatever it needs to be doing. A ship can carry as many modules as it has space and can be upgraded with multiple options, but only once per type of upgrade unless it says otherwise.

### MODULES

Modules are sizable upgrades to a ship, usually sizable enough that they actually take up space. This could be something like a reinforced brig for locking people up or a large jettison on the rear of your ship that you can pile trash in and release back at pursuers during a fight. Installing these consume a portion of a ship's cargo storage. Cargo storage can't go below 0.

Modules, like ship weapons and a ship's sails, have 10 hull points. If the module takes damage, such as from the Fighter Helmsman's Targeted Attack feature and is reduced to 0 hull points, the module is disabled until the Boatswain repairs it using their Fix It Up bridge crew action.

Most shipwrights can install a module at any major port city, but they may not have all modules available to buy. If you come in with your own module, expect the shipwright to charge you for the labor of installing your new module.

#### ANCHOR
**Ship module**

Shaped exactly like its seafaring counterpart, this anchor can be lowered down from a ship to land, creating a magical field to keep the wildjammer afloat even if a Helmsman isn't at the helm powering it.

#### ARCANE AMPLIFIER
**Ship module, requires a hardpoint of medium or large size**

The arcane amplifier is a unique module in that it must be installed in a medium or large hardpoint rather than using up cargo space. In place of that hardpoint, this cannon allows a spellcaster to amplify offensive evocation spells to mega scale as mega spells. To use the arcane amplifier, you must be a spellcaster and you must be in the Gunner bridge crew role.

To use the arcane amplifier, you must first use your action to charge it for one round. Charging the weapon doesn't expend a spell slot, but if the amplifier is not used on the next round, it discharges harmlessly and must be charged again.

If you use your action to cast an evocation spell into the charged amplifier, you may choose a ship or mega creature instead of a creature as the target for the spell. The spell must have a duration of instantaneous and a range of 5 feet or greater. The DM can decide if a spell is inappropriate to be magnified by the amplifier.

The arcane amplifier transforms the spell into a mega spell, and is subject to all the normal limitations of mega spells. Its range and the dimensions of its spell effects are multiplied by 100, to a maximum range of 10,000 feet. Also the spell deals mega damage instead of normal damage.

#### ARCANE FONT
**Ship module, requires Wildjammer Helm**

This device is another creation by the Arcane to add value to using their helms over others. When installed, this device is attached to a ship's hull and has a magical connection to the ship's Wildjammer Helm. As a ship sails, it gathers residual magical energy from the aether and phlogiston.

A creature can activate this as an action. When they do, the device casts the Automatic Helm spell at 3rd level. Once this device has been activated, it can't be used again for 24 hours.
#### ASTROLABE
**Ship module**

This large illusion generated can be affixed to a ship inside of a dark room. When within a crystal sphere, it can be activated to generate an illusory representation of nearly celestial bodies in a 3-dimensional image. It displays their orbital paths, rotations, and current locations relative to your ship. Unfortunately, it can't pick up particularly small celestial bodies.

Although not on the market, it is said there are versions of the Astrolabe that work in the phlogiston to show nearby crystal spheres should you get lost. Unfortunately, they are rare to find.

#### BRIG
**Ship module**

For whatever reason, a ship might have need of a space where they can lock people up. It might be for keeping a criminal alive on their way back to the law, it could be for disciplining mutinous crew members, or even for transporting slaves.

This room is designed for containing up to 5 medium creatures with a reasonable assurance against their escape. The details of the room and the security on it are decided at module installation. If this module is disabled, anyone in the brig is freed to move about the ship as normal.

#### CHAMELEON ORB
**Ship module**

The chameleon orb is a large, room-sized orb covered in arcane runes that builds up residual magical energy during a ship's travels through wildspace which it can use to create a convincing illusion while landed.

Anyone aboard a ship can activate the chameleon orb. When activated, it generates an illusion of the surrounding landscape, hiding the ship from the sight of those outside of where the air bubble would be. A creature can make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to attempt to see through the illusion.

This illusion can persist for up to a month before deactivating. Unfortunately, the illusion ends early if a Helmsman attunes to the ship's helm, as the magic of the helm disrupts the chameleon orb.

#### FIGHTER BAY
**Ship module, requires a ship of Sloop size or larger**

This fighter bay can store one fighter-sized ship for use by a Fighter Helmsman.

#### INVISIBILITY AMPLIFIER
**Ship module**

The invisibility amplifier is another in the amplifier family of ship modules, taking the form of a pair of large gems embedded on opposite ends of the hull. When a creature casts the Invisibility spell, they can touch the ship and have the spell amplified to mega scale. Until the spell ends, everything inside of the ship's air bubble is invisible to anyone outside of it. The spell ends early if anyone aboard the ship makes a Ship Weapon Attack, casts a mega spell, or if the ship moves more than 500 feet in a turn.

#### JETTISON
**Ship module**

A jettison is a sectioned off portion of a ship's cargo hold, usually at the aft section of the ship. When filled with trash and debris, any bridge crew officer can use an action to release it behind the ship. This functions as a physical version of the Jettison spell, cast at 2nd level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you refill the jettison with debris and trash.

The cargo storage of the debris and trash is included in the installation of the jettison. If you choose to store valuables in the jettison, it can hold up to 2 tons of cargo. Be wary, if a jettison is disabled, everything stored inside spills out into wildspace.
#### LIFEBOATS
**Ship module**

These specialized pods are enchanted to hone in on the nearest planet-sized celestial body with air and fall onto it. If there is no valid target, the lifeboat drifts aimlessly through wildspace, conserving air for those inside for up to a month.

Lifeboats are reinforced enough that they can protect the occupants from most damage, and they are small enough that ship weapons lack the precision to hit them. They are too small to have a wildjammer helm or to travel at jamming speeds. Once the lifeboat lands on a planet or runs out of its month of air, it is disabled and becomes inoperable.

Each lifeboat takes up 1 ton of cargo space and can carry 5 medium creatures to safety.

#### PASSAGE DEVICE
**Ship module, requires a Wildjammer Helm**

A passage device is an arcanomechanical invention by the Arcane designed to help sell Wildjammer Helms. The device collects residual magical energy during travel which can be accessed by the Helmsman to cast the Create Portal spell once every 24 hours, but it can only be used on ships with a Wildjammer Helm. This added convenience in bypassing the threshold of a crystal sphere has helped to make the Wildjammer Helm popular.

#### PLANE SHIFT AMPLIFIER
**Ship module, requires a ship with an attuned Helmsman**

Another in the amplifier line, this module is a pair of planar attuned gems affixed to the hull of your ship which can resonate with and amplify the power of the Plane Shift spell.

When a creature casts the Plane Shift spell, they can touch the ship with their tuning fork and have the spell amplified to mega scale. The spell now transports the ship along with everything and everyone aboard it to the destination of the spell.

This amplification doesn't work unless there is a Helmsman actively attuned to the helm. If this spell is cast on a ship with an unwilling Helmsman, they must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against the spell save DC of the caster to resist the effect.

#### PORTAL LOCATOR
**Ship module, requires a Wildjammer Helm**

Much like the Passage Device, the Portal Locator was built by the Arcane to help ships get in and out of spheres more easily. Unlike the Passage Device, the Portal Locator isn't limited to just ships with a Wildjammer Helm.

When activated by the Helmsman as an action, this instrument casts the Locate Portal spell and provides the information back to the Helmsman.

#### SENDING CHAMBER
**Ship module**

A Sending Chamber is a room in the ship with a special sending orb installed. This crystal clear orb allows for long distance communication between ships with a Sending Chamber without the limitations of Sending. This has become an essential tool for many wildjammers.

A creature can activate this orb as an action, sending a magical link to the Sending Chamber of another ship with which they are familiar. This link can reach across the spheres, but not between planes. When this link is sent, both orbs become cloudy and the Helmsman of each ship becomes aware of the attempted link. Nothing is conveyed between the link until either the Helmsman or a creature in the Sending Chamber of the destination ship accepts the link.

When the link is established, either Helmsman and any creature touching either orb may project their mind into a shared mental space. While in this shared space, the creature's body is incapacitated and they are not aware of or able to act aboard their ship. Until they leave, they can speak with anyone else in the shared space, as well as project their thoughts and memories into the space around them.

If all creatures on one side disengage, the link is severed and the creatures of the other side return to their bodies safely.

#### SICKBAY
**Ship module**

Illness and injury are bound to happen when traveling the stars, and without a dedicated healer aboard, a sickbay is a critical facility. The system has a pool of 6 medical dice, which are 1d8s. Each of these dice recharge 24 hours after being used. Anyone aboard can spend 1 minute in the sickbay to expend one of these dice to regain hit points equal to the die rolled. Alternatively, you can expend 3 medical dice to cure one non-magical poison or disease.

#### WORKSHOP
**Ship module**

Whether the workshop is a fully functioning forge, a room full of tools and lumber for a carpenter, or bolts of cloth and threads for a tailor, this room provides anything an artisan would need. Someone with an artisan tool proficiency can make use of this workshop to work on projects during travel. Each workshop is built to fit a single tool proficiency.
### UPGRADES

Upgrades are extra features you can get added to your ship to make it function more efficiently. You can add each upgrade once unless specified otherwise. It takes a week to complete an upgrade.

#### AETHERSAILS
**Sails upgrade, requires a ship of Sloop size or larger**

These specialized sails are designed to pick up on the movements in the aether to aid in moving a ship. Aethersails come in two varieties, and only one can be installed on a ship at a time.

**Adaptable Sails.** After moving, your ship can turn an additional 45º. This doesn't increase the cone in which your ship can move, just how much you turn after.

**Gliding Sails.** Your ship has an extra 500 feet of movement when moving in a straight line.

#### ARCANE WEAPONRY
**Ship weapon upgrade, requires a ship weapon**

One ship weapon's firing system is changed from a physical system to a magical one. To use this weapon, a Gunner must have the spellcasting or pact magic feature. When the Gunner makes a ship weapon attack using this ship weapon, they use their spellcasting ability modifier instead of their Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack roll. Additionally, if the Gunner lacks the Extra Attack feature but has access to 3rd level spell slots, they are considered to have Extra Attack when using this ship weapon.

#### ASSAULT PORT
**Module upgrade, requires a Fighter Bay module**

A Fighter Helmsman can deploy from Fighter Bays as a bonus action instead of as an action.

#### ENCHANTED HULL
**Hull upgrade**

Your ship's hull is enchanted to be stronger, making it better able to shrug off attacks.

Your ship's AC is increased by 1.

#### ENHANCED WEAPON
**Ship weapon upgrade**

This enchantment upgrades a ship weapon so that ammunition fired from it actively seeks to home in on helms or mega creatures. This weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls and has its normal range increased by 500 ft.

This bonus can increase to +2 and +3, but such magic is not readily available on the market. Enchantment of this power level is the work of highly skilled enchanters and shipwrights.

#### GUNPOWDER STATION
**Hardpoint upgrade, requires a ship hardpoint**

One of your ship's hardpoints has a gunpowder station built nearby. Cannons mounted on this hardpoint ignore the Loading property. You can purchase this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different hardpoint each time.

#### HELM LINK
**Helm upgrade, requires a helm**

Your ship's helm can be linked to the helm of another willing wildjammer. When either ship accelerates to jamming speeds, the other is carried along.

Your wildjammer must be able to have a helm to accept this upgrade.
#### REINFORCED BULWARK
**Hull upgrade**

The ship's internal reinforcements are fine tuned with the help of the Boatswain.

Your ship's bulwark points increase by 8.

#### REINFORCED COMPONENT
**Module, sails, & ship weapon upgrade**

One of your wildjammer's weapons, modules, or your ship's sails is reinforced. This weapon, module, or the ship's sails have 20 hull points instead of 10. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different weapon, module, or to your ship's sails.

#### REINFORCED HULL
**Hull upgrade**

You have improved the integrity of your wildjammer by padding the hull with lightweight reinforcement.

Your ship's hull points increase by 16.

#### TURRETED HARDPOINT
**Hardpoint upgrade, requires a ship hardpoint**

One of your wildjammer's hardpoints has a turret platform added to it. When a Gunner uses a weapon mounted on this hardpoint, they can use a bonus action to turn the hardpoint to change the facing of the mounted weapon. You can choose this upgrade more than once, applying it to a different hardpoint.

### Upgrades Table

| Upgrade Name | Cost |
|--------------|------|
| Aethersails | 4,000gp |
| Arcane Weaponry | 1,000gp |
| Assault Port | 3,000gp |
| Enchanted Hull | 5,000gp |

| Reinforced Bulwark | 5,000gp |
| Reinforced Component | 2,500gp |
| Reinforced Hull | 4,000gp |
| Turreted Hardpoint | 2,000gp |
## FORE MANTLE

Every wildjammer is created with a heavily reinforced mount on the front of the ship called a fore mantle. This fore mantle can be equipped with a special device for use by the Helmsman while sailing the ship. There are two major types of fore mantle items: ship melee weapons including rams and magical figureheads. A wildjammer can have only one equipped at a time. The items listed in this section are only those regularly available to player characters. There are still other items unique to certain wildjammer designs.

Like ship weapons, sails, and other modules, fore mantle equipment have 10 hull points and are disabled when reduced to 0 hull points until repaired.

### RAMS & SHIP MELEE WEAPONS

Rams and ship melee weapons can be affixed to the front of a wildjammer. A ram is a heavily reinforced fore mantle attachment that can reduce the damage your ship takes when intentionally colliding into a ship or mega creature. A ship melee weapon is usually some form of physical attachment allowing the ship's Helmsman to attack another ship or mega creature.

#### RAM
**Fore mantle ship module**

This large ram is affixed to the front of a ship is built to absorb the backlash from colliding with another ship. While this ram is equipped, when the Helmsman takes the Collide bridge crew action and hits, the damage dice this ship takes is reduced to d4s.

#### GRAPPLING RAM
**Fore mantle ship module**

Unlike the a normal ram, a grappling ram isn't built for absorbing damage from a forward collision. Instead, it is designed for grappling another ship so the boarding party can get aboard quickly and easily.

While this ram is equipped, when the Helmsman takes the Collide bridge crew action and hits, both ships are immediately in a ship grapple (escape DC 13).

#### GRAPPLER ARMS
**Fore mantle ship weapon, Frigate-sized (1x1) or larger**

These fore mantle attachment is a set of manipulators that extend out from the front half of the ship. In lieu of colliding with an enemy ship, the Helmsman can use these manipulators to bludgeon or grapple a ship or mega creature. Grappler arms must be installed at ship creation, and they cannot be added, removed, or later replaced by another fore mantle option.

When the Helmsman takes the Collide bridge crew action while at the Helm of a ship with these arms, the Helmsman instead moves the ship up to half its speed within its cone of movement and makes a special ship weapon attack using their spellcasting ability modifier instead of their Strength or Dexterity against a ship or mega creature within 500 feet. The Helmsman is considered proficient with this weapon. On hit, these arms deal 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage.

Instead of attacking with these arms, the Helmsman may attempt to grapple a ship or mega creature. The Helmsman makes an Athletics check using their spellcasting ability modifier contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If the target is a ship with a Helmsman, that Helmsman may use their spellcasting ability modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for this contested check. The target of the grapple must be no more than one size larger than your ship, and it must be within 500 feet of your ship.
### FIGUREHEAD

Most figureheads that a sailor sees are purely ornamental, decoration added to the front of a ship for appearances only. Nevertheless, there are some shipwrights and enchanters that have worked together to build magical figureheads that provide boons to a ship. The magic of these figureheads is activated by the Helmsman on their turn.

#### DRAGON FIGUREHEAD
**Fore mantle ship module**

The shape of a dragon's upper body is affixed to the front of the ship, just below the bowsprit (if any). This dragon's head gathers up residual magical power from the aether that it can release as a breath weapon.

As an action, you may have the figurehead breath fire in a 3,000-foot cone ahead of the ship. Each ships or mega creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against the Helmsman's spell save DC. On a failure, they take 28 (8d6) mega fire damage and can't regain bulwark points until the end of your next turn. On a success, they take half damage and can regain bulwark points as normal.

Once this ability has been activated, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

#### COUATL FIGUREHEAD
**Fore mantle ship module**

A serpentine couatl with rainbow wings is affixed to the front of the ship, just below the bowsprit (if any). This couatl gathers up residual magical power from the aether that it can use to repair the ship.

As an action, you may unleash the power of the figurehead to repair the ship for 4d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

Once this ability has been activated, it can't be used again for 24 hours.

#### DISPLACER BEAST FIGUREHEAD
**Fore mantle ship module**

The image of a displacer beast with its tentacles out to its sides is affixed to the front of the ship, just below the bowsprit (if any). The displacer beast gathers up residual magical power from the aether that it can use to defend the ship.

As an action, you may activate the figurehead, which creates magical illusions of your ship nearby its actual location. This causes attack rolls against your ship to have disadvantage. If your ship is hit by an attack, this effect is disrupted until the end of your next turn. This effect is also disrupted if your ship is destroyed or grappled by another ship. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Once this ability has been activated, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

### Fore Mantle Module Table

| Module Name | Cost |
|-------------|------|
| Ram | 2,500gp |
| Grappling Ram | 2,500gp |
| Grappler Arms | 10,000gp |
| Dragon Figurehead | 5,000gp |
| Couatl Figurehead | 5,000gp |
| Displacer Beast Figurehead | 7,500gp |

## HULLS

The hull of a wildjammer is the large frame which holds everything else. Hulls can be made of different materials, bringing about a variety of different style ships, though they can generally be clumped into families based on the shape of the hull.

In this section, I'm going to start by going over the different figures you'll see when looking at a wildjammer's stat block. In normal fifth edition terms, this is the section where I explain hit points, armor class, movement speed, and the like. After that, we'll dig right into the wildjammers themselves, with a long list of wildjammers organized by size and value.

### WILDJAMMER ATTRIBUTES

Just like the ships from the Age of Sail, wildjammers tend to have a lot of unique character to each of them. While there are many commonalities from one to another, people generally like to vary it a bit. Even two wildjammers crafted in the same place will tend to have slight variations in room layout and overall form.

That said, there are some general attributes that wildjammers tend to have.

#### ARMOR CLASS (AC)

Armor Class is treated identically to how you are used to it from D&D 5e. Attacks that meet or beat the Armor Class of a wildjammer hit.

#### HULL POINTS (HP)

Hull Points is the short-hand name we use for mega hit points with regards to wildjammers. Each hull point represents 100 regular hit points. When a ship's hull reaches 0 hull points, the ship ceases to operate until it has regained at least 1 hull point. During this time, the ship can't move and can be automatically grappled by another ship. Destroying a ship entirely requires a focused effort by the attacker outside of combat.

#### BULWARK POINTS (BP)

In fifth edition, ships generally shrug off damage through the damage threshold stat. In Wildjammer, we forgo the use of damage threshold in favor of a new mechanic called Bulwark Points (BP). Bulwark points represent the same basic idea, but instead of simply ignoring small amounts of damage, this represents a buffer that can be easily repaired. In mechanical terms, bulwark points are like temporary hit points: whenever an attack hits the wildjammer, damage is first dealt to the ship's bulwark points.

Although hull points take significant time to repair, bulwark points are refreshed each turn so long as the ship has a boatswain (more in Bridge Crew Roles).

#### SPEED

See the Speeds section (pg. 31) for more information. Speed is made up of two values, a movement speed and a maneuverability score. The speed of a ship is largely based on the ship's design, weight, and the way the helm converts magical power from the Helmsman into propulsion. If a ship has no Helmsman, the ship's speed is reduced to 0 ft.

Similarly, maneuverability is based on a ship's sails and the crew working them. If a ship's sails become disabled, the ship's maneuverability drops to 0º, and if the ship has too few crew, penalties can be applied. See the Interaction With Crew section (pg. 32) for more.

Some wildjammers will have upgrades or features that grant them additional movement speed or abilities that help them move around the battlefield.

#### HARDPOINTS

Hardpoints represent the number of slots available for siege weaponry onboard your wildjammer, as well as their facing. A weapon can be affixed to a hardpoint with any facing, but if the weapon is fixed, it can only fire in a 90º angle once it is installed. Some hardpoint positions on a wildjammer add the fixed property to weapons mounted there.

There are 3 sizes of hardpoints that can exist on a wildjammer: small, medium, and large. A ship mounted weapon can fit on a hardpoint of the same size or greater. For example, a Light Catapult (small) can be installed on a small, medium, or large hardpoint, but a Heavy Catapult (large) can only be installed on a large hardpoint.

#### CREW (MIN/MAX)

This represents how many people are needed at minimum to operate the sails and keep the ship moving. This number doesn't include the crew requirement for operating ship mounted weapons.

Crew above the minimum isn't essential, though if you lose crew members while sailing through space, your ships maneuverability will suffer. Refer to the table "Crew Deficit" on page 32 to determine your wildjammer's maneuverability when it has less than the minimum crew available.

A wildjammer with no crew has no maneuverability and can only turn in big, clumsy arcs. With regards to tactical speed, the wildjammer can't turn in combat. Nevertheless, if it has enough time, it can make turns and slowly drag itself back to a port for a new crew and likely some much needed repairs.

#### SIZE

Wildjammers come in many different sizes, but based on ground scale, they would all be gargantuan. Since that doesn't help us all that much, this supplement uses an alternate breakdown of sizes similar to that of ground scale, just the mega equivalent. The names have been changed to match some Age of Sail terminology, but they are all ultimately just mega + ground equivalent size.

| Fifth Edition Sizes | Class Name | Grid Dimensions |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| Tiny | Fighter | 0.5 x 0.5 |
| Small | Schooner | 1 x 1 |
| Medium | Sloop | 1 x 1 |
| Large | Frigate | 2 x 2 |
| Huge | Heavy Frigate | 3 x 3 |
| Gargantuan | Ship of the Line | 4 x 4 |

#### CARGO HOLD

Cargo hold is simply a measure of how much available room there is on the wildjammer. This can be used for transporting trade goods between planets and spheres, carrying large sums of loot, or as shelter for people who need help getting somewhere else.

#### DAYS OF AIR

This refers to the number of days of fresh air a ship can sustain a single person. If a wildjammer has 600 days of fresh air in its air bubble, it can sustain a single person for 600 days before the air becomes fouled, and then 600 more days before it becomes lethal.

Most wildjammers have crews with more than a single person, meaning you will need to do just a tiny bit of math. Simply divide the total days of fresh air by the number of people aboard, and you'll get how many days it can sustain that crew.

For example, let's say we have a ship with 10 people on it and the ship's air bubble has 600 days of fresh air. We would take 600, divide it by 10, and get 60. So this ship has enough air to sustain people for 60 days before going foul, and then for 60 more days before becoming lethal.
#### LANDING

While all wildjammers are designed to operate when sailing through space, their ability to function on a planet can be somewhat limited depending on the model. All wildjammers are capable of hover sailing which allows them to either fly like an airship or skim the surface of water at exceptional speeds, but not all of them can actually touch down on a planet safely without a Helmsman remaining attuned to the helm to keep it hovering above the surface.

If a wildjammer shows that it is able to land in water, that means that the wildjammer can both land and sail in water. A ship that can land on land has landing gear that can keep the ship's hull from touching down fully, like the wheels of a plane.

Most wildjammer crews will do their best to avoid contact with groundling civilization. There are more than a few tales of a group of groundlings stealing a wildjammer from an unwary crew. The best way to avoid that fate is to go without anyone knowing what you have. Remember, a wildjammer is a valuable magic item, and there are many who would like to have it for themselves.

Luckily, most ships that can land on water and sail through water are built to look like regular ships, just with exotic design. Such ships may catch some eyes, but they are usually inconspicuous enough to pull into harbor safely.

> #### Outside of an Air Bubble
> Creatures that leave a wildjammer air bubble carry 1 minute worth of air with them. This air fouls after a minute. A minute after that, a character can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

> #### Provisions for Long Voyages
> All wildjammers come with a pantry that can support the maximum crew count of the ship for 3 months without taking up cargo space.
>
> If you're going on a long voyage though, you may want to stock up! Every 1 ton of cargo storage you fill with food and water can provide 2,400 days of sustenance for 1 person. Divide 2,400 by the number of people you have to supply for and you'll have the number of days 1 ton can sustain.
>
> The cost of food and water is included in the daily cost of crew members to make food and water management simple. If you add passengers or stock up, the cost of food and water is 5 silver per person per day, or 1,200gp for 1 ton.

> #### Repairing your Ship
> Repairing hull points isn't a quick process. Once per day, the Boatswain can roll a DC 15 Intelligence (carpenter's tools) check. On a success, they can repair the ship's hull and/or any damaged modules, ship weapons, sails, etc. for a total number of hull points equal to ten times their proficiency bonus. On a failure, they repair half as many hull points. Only one check can be made each day for the entire ship and all of its components.
